There are 2 queries in the folder one as AdHOC Solution and second one as a stored procedure.
1) The ADHOC solution is based on importing data from text file so the folder location needs to be changed server folder location.
 for example the dataset location in the solution is '\\nhqtwra1\c$\testfolder\Learning\ChallengeSampleDataSet1.txt' where 'nhqtwra1' is ServerName.

2) For Stored Procedure database name [DW] needs to be changed to a database on the server and like ADHOC solution folder location needs to be changed to server name.
	
	EXEC [dbo].[ETL1A_CODING_CHALLENGE] @datasetOveride = '\\nhqtwra1\c$\testfolder\Learning\ChallengeSampleDataSet2.txt'
