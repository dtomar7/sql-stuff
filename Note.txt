There are 2 queries in the folder one AdHOC Solution and second a stored procedure.
1) The ADHOC solution is based on importing data from text file so the folder location needs to be changed server folder location.
 for example the dataset location in the solution is '\\server\c$\download\Computershare - Coding Challenge\ChallengeSampleDataSet1.txt'.
 
2) For Stored Procedure database name [DW] needs to be changed to a database on the server and like ADHOC solution dataset path needs to be changed to the folder location on the server.
	
	EXEC [dbo].[ETL1A_CODING_CHALLENGE] @datasetOveride = '\\server\c$\download\Computershare - Coding Challenge\ChallengeSampleDataSet2.txt'
